This is an on-going project for network management and automation solution designed to streamline the configuration, monitoring, and maintenance of networking devices. Built on the principles of Clean Architecture, the project leverages a .NET Core API for exposing RESTful APIs and Ansible playbooks for interacting with networking devices.

**Key Features:**

- Clean Architecture: Ensures separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability.

- Ansible Playbooks: Automate interactions with networking devices using Ansible.

- API Endpoints: Expose a set of APIs for configuring, retrieving information, and monitoring networking devices.

- Security Integration: Implement secure communication and integrate security features into the network infrastructure.

- Scalability: Designed to scale horizontally to handle growing network demands.
